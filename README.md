# Puzzle Palooza
Developed using Java, JDBC, and MySQL, this project is inspired by the Kaun Banega Crorepati quiz format. It enables interactive and engaging general knowledge questions while providing lifelines to assist users in answering. By seamlessly connecting the quiz application with the MySQL database, it ensures smooth storage and retrieval of questions, options, and user responses. The project showcases my expertise in Java, JDBC, and MySQL, along with strong database design principles, data manipulation, and query optimization, resulting in an efficient and responsive quiz platform.
